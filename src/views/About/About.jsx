        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>
          Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet. I'm a software
          engineer in the Pacific Northwest. Before building things on the
          internet, I was a digital marketer and a pastry chef. Iâ€™ve always
          loved making things and solving problems, and have always done so with
          people as my motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to learn software development because I believed I could use
          technology to solve bigger, more human-centered problems.
        </p>
        <p>It's nice to see you!</p>
