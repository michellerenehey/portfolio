          Hi! Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet. I'm a
          software engineer in Portland, OR. Before building things on the
          internet, I was a digital marketer and a pastry chef. Iâ€™ve always
          loved making things and solving problems, and have always done so with{' '}
          <strong>people</strong> as my motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to learn software development because I believed I could use
          technology to solve bigger, more human-centered problems.
        </p>
        <p>It's nice to see you!</p>
